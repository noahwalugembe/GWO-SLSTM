The proposed **GWO–SLSTM** model synergistically combines:
- The Grey Wolf Optimizer's metaheuristic parameter search,
- The Spiking LSTM's ability to encode temporal dependencies with
  biologically inspired membrane potentials and surrogate gradients.

This fusion enables smooth convergence and stable forecasting performance
in highly non-stationary financial data such as Bitcoin prices.

Figure Descriptions and Interpretations
------------------------------------------------------------

**Fig. 1 – Comprehensive Training History (training_history_comprehensive.png)**  
This figure displays the temporal evolution of MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and PBIAS across
training epochs for both training and validation sets.

• The MSE and RMSE values exhibit a monotonic decline followed by stabilization,
  showing strong learning convergence.  
• The validation loss closely tracks the training curve, implying minimal overfitting.  
• MAPE (%) decreases rapidly, indicating improving relative prediction accuracy
  as the model adjusts spike thresholds through gradient adaptation.
• PBIAS (%) shows the model's bias tendency: positive values indicate underestimation,
  negative values indicate overestimation. The convergence near zero demonstrates
  balanced prediction behavior.

**Interpretation:**  
Model accuracy improves progressively with each epoch, stabilizing near
epoch 35–40. During early epochs, the optimizer's exploration term (A)
permits broad search of learning rates and weight decays, while later
epochs exploit fine-tuned adjustments. This adaptive process enhances
the SLSTM's capacity to retain relevant temporal patterns and discard noise.

------------------------------------------------------------

**Fig. 2 – Bitcoin Price Prediction (bitcoin_price_prediction.png)**  
This figure compares actual BTC–USD prices with GWO–SLSTM predictions
on the unseen test set.

• The predicted trajectory mirrors the real market trend, capturing both
  short-term fluctuations and long-term growth phases.  
• Minor deviations occur during high-volatility regions, typical of crypto assets.  
• The model's adaptive spiking thresholding allows recovery from transient
  prediction errors.

**Interpretation:**  
Accuracy varies across volatility regimes:
- In stable intervals, neuron membrane potentials remain consistent,
  producing smooth, low-error predictions.  
- During price jumps, transient overshooting occurs but quickly dampens
  due to GWO-optimized weight decay control.  

Overall, the test MAPE of **2.51%** and RMSE of
**55.4397** confirm strong generalization ability.

PBIAS Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------

**Percent Bias (PBIAS) Interpretation:**
- Train PBIAS: 1.6895% → excellent model performance
- Test PBIAS: -0.0193% → excellent model performance

PBIAS measures the average tendency of simulated values to be larger (negative PBIAS)
or smaller (positive PBIAS) than observed values. Our model shows minimal bias,
indicating balanced predictions without systematic overestimation or underestimation.
